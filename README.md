# KiraSoftware-MisGastosV2

This is the v2 of a previous POC to KiraSoft.
In this version I want to emphasize four points that I consider are the more relevant respect to the previous version:

1.- The Serilog use for loging
2.- The new estructure of the arechitecture
3.- The Safe Executor use
4.- The IAnswerBase use to return a standard answer for all access point of our api rest.

You can could watch the explaneid video on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdqwVu5IJQ0

Tanks for watch.
